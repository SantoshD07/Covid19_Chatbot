# Introduction:
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.
Bringing about awareness to the people about the current situation and giving them access to important information at the right time is one of the key service that one can possibly provide amidst the global pandemic.

# Project Description: 

As the title suggests, The project is named Clippy. Clippy a response chatbot which is a live COVID19 tracker which gives numerical figures of COVID19 in India on your fingertips. The bot gives information state-wise and district wise and gives you information on when the data was last updated.
The data is fetched from covid19india.org which is a crowdsourced initiative which gathers data from state bulletins and official handles to update the numbers. The data is validated by a group of volunteers and published into a Google sheet and an API. 

Clippy is made using Python and Json Scripting which is then hosted on Heroku and the webhook feed is then linked to Twilio. Twilio is a cloud based communications platform which allows you to test and prototype messaging via WhatsApp using the Twilio API
With the Twilio Sandbox for WhatsApp, you can prototype with WhatsApp immediately, without waiting for your Twilio number to be approved for WhatsApp. The Twilio Sandbox is pre-provisioned with a Twilio phone number that is shared across all sandbox users

To Try it out send a text message to +1 (415) 523-8886 saying “join connected-handle” to join the Twilio Sandbox and greet Clippy by texting it a “Hi/Hey”
